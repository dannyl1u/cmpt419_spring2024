## Notes

This is a quick set of notes to accompany the data scaling lecture slides.

First, we talked about the answers to the quiz. A key notes to highlight:

- We want to know "what can training influence do"
- We should look out for questions that claim influence scores will fix "all biases" or solve "all data quality issues"
