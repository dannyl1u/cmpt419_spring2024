## General structure of our "lecture" time:

- Each Monday, we’ll discuss the previous week’s readings and I’ll introduce any readings and assignments for the week.
  - I’ll aim to hold at least 5-10 min every Monday to walk through assignments together and take questions – you’re welcome to use this time to start working on them and see if questions arise.
- On Wednesday we’ll use about an hour for a traditional slides-style lecture. We’ll use another hour for some kind of class activity. We may use some of this time to work on assignments and projects and to take quizzes or practice quizzes.
  - I’ll always take questions at the beginning and end of each lecture session. You’re always welcome to email me, but I may take 2-3 business days to respond to emails. Asking questions in class will provide a quicker response and your classmates may benefit from your questions as well!



### **About course assignments:**



* Each week has a set of assigned readings:
    * There will be a set of mandatory readings.
    * There will also be some optional readings. You are encouraged to read the abstracts and/or Introduction sections of the optional readings to see if they align with what you hope to get out of the class. I’ll do my best to organize these by theme, and will add more based on the interests you express.
    * Each week, you’ll submit some relatively brief “reading responses” via Canvas.
* Assigned readings for Week *X *are considered “finalized” on Monday of the preceding week (Week *X-1*), and should be completed by Monday of *Week X*. Each reading response will be due at 4:29pm on Monday (so that class time will be more useful!)
    * For example: During class on Monday of Week 1, I’ll post and tell you all the required readings for Week 2, which you should finish over the next 7 days.
    * I’ll try to provide a draft of course material ahead of time, but it may be subject to change based on your feedback, course progress, and even current events – so you should check the readings each Monday after class


### **About course organization**



* The course will be organized in terms of 4 “modules”
    * Module 1: Administration and Introduction (Weeks 1-4, 4 in total)
    * Module 2: Data Valuation and Scaling. (Weeks 5-7, 3 in total)
    * Module 3: Online platforms and user-generated content ecosystems. (Weeks 8-10, 3 in total).
    * Module 4: Data governance, markets, and more (Week 11-13, 3 in total).
    * Self-directed exploration and project.
    * We will have one assignment per module (coding / data analysis).


## **Course FAQs**



* Is attendance mandatory?
    * While I won’t check attendance, you are highly encouraged to attend class whenever you are able to. I am very supportive of students staying home when sick, and understand a variety of personal situations may arise that prevent you from going to class. You do not need to email me to miss class, but are welcome to ask follow up questions (I may just point you to the class notes and encourage you to talk to your classmates).
    * In short, to earn a high mark in this class, I encourage you to plan to attend all lectures you are able to.
* Will this class involve coding?
    * Yes, there will be some coding assignments in the class that are designed to give hands-on experience with certain course concepts. You are free to use a variety of programming languages and tools for these assignments, though will be encouraged to use some “standard” solutions based (primarily: Python for ML and data science related components, Javascript and web-programming for some design components)
* How many assignments will we have?
    * You will complete 4 assignments (involving coding and data analysis) and 1 project.
* Can I work in a group?
    * There will be opportunities to do group work, but you must write a contribution statement for everything. You must review *all* your team’s code and writing! Individual assignments that allow group work will have specific details for how this will work.
* What’s the deal with late assignments?
    * For serious personal circumstances (e.g. medical issues) please let me know and we’ll work something out.
    * I can’t accommodate individual extensions (e.g., “I have a midterm that day”), but will give everyone one free late assignment to help with this (see below). I will collect frequent feedback about course workload and may extend deadlines accordingly.
    * There will be 13 reading responses, due each Monday starting Week 2 at 4:29pm. You can turn in one reading response up to 3 days late, no questions asked.
    * There will be 4 coding assignments. You can turn in one coding assignment up to 3 days late, no questions asked.
    * To use your "free late assignment", just email me a note with subject line “CMPT 419 LATE ASSIGNMENT” and include in the body “I am turning in assignment *XYZ *late” (it doesn’t have to be that exact text, but helps me keep track of email!)
* Are there quizzes, a midterm, and/or a final exam?
    * There may be some in-class quizzes. They will be announced in advance and some kind of make-up option will be available for sick students. Any “testable” material will be drawn only from in class lecture materials and mandatory readings.
    * There will be a final exam, currently scheduled for the final week of class. It will cover the same material as the quizzes, but will be cumulative.
    * The goal of both quizzes and the final are to provide additional incentives to engage with material each week.
* What materials do I need?
    * Reading materials will be provided digitally by the instructor. There will be no single textbook -- rather, we will read an assortment of research papers, book chapters, etc.
    * You will be asked to spend some time installing software tools on your own. You will have some flexibility in which tools you choose – there will always be a free option available.
* Can I use ChatGPT?
    * You may use generative AI tools to assist with your coursework, but must provide complete logs for any outputs you use directly and any artifacts you submit should indicate the provenance of any unedited generative AI outputs.
        * e.g., “This slide was produced by model *XYZ*”
        * “This summary paragraph or code snippet was produced entirely by ChatGPT”
        * “This code was generated with the help of ChatGPT, but heavily edited”
    * **Individual assignments may have specific requirements you should pay attention to**
