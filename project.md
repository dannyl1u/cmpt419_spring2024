## Finding a template

You may want to write in Latex (perhaps using Overleaf) if you want to practice writing something in the style of a computing paper.

You can use the ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article Template

On [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc) or on [acm.org](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
